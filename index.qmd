Hello, my name is NathanaÃ«l Soulage, I am currently a student enrolled in the Research Master's in Economics at Sciences Po Paris. I am willing to pursue research in Economics, therefore this website is designed to present and share my work, projects and skills. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from Sciences Po Paris, with a major in Economics. I am now in my second year of Research Master's degree in Economics, graduating in June 2025. For more details you can find my resume [here](NathanaelSoulage_resume.pdf). 

Many thanks to the amazing Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias, who created a wonderful tutorial to create a [Research Portfolio](https://www.paulogcd.com/portfolio_tutorial/)
