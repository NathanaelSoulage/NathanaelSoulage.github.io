Hello, my name is Nathanaël Soulage, I am currently working as a predoc for Prof. Stefanie Stantcheva (Harvard University). My main areas of interest span Public, Labor and Macro-Economics, with complemntary interest in Trade and Environmental. Willing to pursue research in Economics, this website is designed to present and share my work, projects and skills. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from Sciences Po Paris, with a major in Economics. I then completed a Research Master's degree in Economics, at Sciences Po, graduating in June 2025. For more details you can find my resume [here](Nathanael_Soulage_resume.pdf). 

Many thanks to the amazing Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias, who created a wonderful tutorial to create your own [Research Portfolio](https://www.paulogcd.com/portfolio_tutorial/)
