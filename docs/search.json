    "text": "Replication of Wage stagnation and the decline of standardized pay rates (Massenkoff & Wilmers, 2023)\nFor my Labor Economics class (taught by Prof. Pierre Cahuc), I chose to replicate, conducting robustness checks and producing extension, this paper on the drivers of blue-collar wage stagnation in the 1970s-1990s in the US. I found that, in line with the authors findings, the decline of standardized pay rates in the late 1970s and 1980s contributed significantly to wage stagnation, a finding that is robust to the tests that I performed. Moreover, I refined their analysis by showing that the wage decline has primarily been driven by firms moving away from fully standardized pay structures, with no within-job pay variation, rather than from tenure-based pay. Additionally, I found that bonuses, when used in a firm, primarily benefit white-collar workers, while the effects of piece-rate pay, though apparently significant, are harder to generalize due to limited presence in the data.\n\nYou can find the original paper, its appendix, and its replication package at this link.\nMy replication study is available here"

You will find here a list of ongoing or past projects I worked on :\n\nReplication of Wage stagnation and the decline of standardized pay rates (Massenkoff & Wilmers, 2023) : For my Labor Economics class (Prof. Pierre Cahuc), I chose to replicate, conducting robustness checks and producing extension, this paper on the drivers of blue-collar wage stagnation in the 1970s-1990s in the US.\nMacroeconomics short presentation of “The Wealth Inequality of Nations” (Pfeffer and Waitkus, 2021), with Jean Fontalirand : We presented two key insights from this empirical paper, which displays an absence of correlation between income and wealth inequality and concentration at the national level, between developed countries, in the data.\nMicroeconomics group project, Game Theory : Modelling class attendance as a game of strategic interactions between students : In our Microeconomics 2 class, we wrote a game theory paper aimed at exploring and explaining the determinants of class attendance, as a game of strategic interactions between the students. In a last extension, we introduced a teacher, as a special player, using student’s strategies to set up her own.\nMacroeconomics Presentation of New Keynesain models: not yet useful for policy analysis (V.V. Chari, Patrick J. Kehoe, Ellen R. McGrattan), with Alexandra Anghel : In macroeconomics 2 class, we presented this paper, which proposed critiques and limits of New Keynesian models and their use and interpretability."
