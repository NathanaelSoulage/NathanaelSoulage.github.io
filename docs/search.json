    "section": "",
    "text": "For my Labor Economics class (taught by Prof. Pierre Cahuc), I chose to replicate, conducting robustness checks and producing extension, this paper on the drivers of blue-collar wage stagnation in the 1970s-1990s in the US.\nI found that, in line with the authors’ findings, the decline of standardized pay rates in the late 1970s and 1980s contributed significantly to wage stagnation, a finding that is robust to the tests that I performed. Moreover, I refined their analysis by showing that the wage decline has primarily (and almost fully) been driven by firms moving away from fully standardized pay structures, with no within-job pay variation, rather than from tenure-based pay. Additionally, I found that bonuses, when used in a firm, primarily benefit white-collar workers, while the effects of piece-rate pay, though apparently significant, are harder to generalize due to limited presence in the data.\n\nYou can find the original paper, its appendix, and its replication package at this link.\nMy replication study is available here"

This year, we were asked to predict the probability (first round) and the intensity (final) of congestion in the German electricity grid. Using machine learning techniques in addition to standard econometric tools, we analysed the determinants of congestion and predicted it on a day-ahead basis. To learn more about the Game, have a look at their website.\nYou can find our work for the first round and the final :\n\nCase A (first round)\nCase B (final)\n\nThis has received some coverage by Sciences Po (here or there)"

    "text": "Welcome to my projects page. You will find here a list of projects I worked on during my Master’s degree:\n\nReplication of Wage stagnation and the decline of standardized pay rates (Massenkoff & Wilmers, 2023) : For my Labor Economics class (taught by Prof. Pierre Cahuc), I chose to replicate, conducting robustness checks and producing extension, this paper on the drivers of blue-collar wage stagnation in the 1970s-1990s in the US.\nPresentation of Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees (Saez and Zucman, 2024), with Alexandra Anghel : In Public Economics class (taught by Prof. Stefan Pollinger) we made a one-hour presentation of this very recent article by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The authors present issues associated with usual distributional tax analysis and propose a brand new framework, to analyse current-tax and tax reform distributional implications. The original paper can be found here\nMacroeconomics short presentation of “The Wealth Inequality of Nations” (Pfeffer and Waitkus, 2021), with Jean Fontalirand : We presented two key insights from this empirical paper, which displays an absence of correlation between income and wealth inequality and concentration at the national level, between developed countries, in the data.\nMicroeconomics group project, Game Theory : Modelling class attendance as a game of strategic interactions between students : In our Microeconomics 2 class (taught by Prof. Emeric Henry, Sciences Po Paris), we wrote a game theory paper aimed at exploring and explaining the determinants of class attendance, as a game of strategic interactions between the students. In a last extension, we introduced a teacher, as a special player, using student’s strategies to set up her own.\nMacroeconomics Presentation of New Keynesain models: not yet useful for policy analysis (V.V. Chari, Patrick J. Kehoe, and Ellen R. McGrattan, 2019), with Alexandra Anghel : In Macroeconomics 2 class (taught by Jean Barthelemy, Banque de France), we presented this paper, which proposed critiques and limits of New Keynesian models and their use and interpretability. The original paper can be found here\n\n\nOther projects\n\nThe Econometric Game 2025 : I represented Sciences Po at the 2025 World Econometric Championship, where we reached the final !
