This page is dedicated to my Master's thesis, written during the Spring 2025 semester, under the supervision of Prof. Antoine Ferey (Sciences Po). Its title: "How to tax housing? Property versus rental taxation". 

In this essay I look at the differential welfare impact of two types of housing taxes: property and rental income taxation.
